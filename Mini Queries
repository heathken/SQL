### Table queries ###

### Pulling all song titles ###

SELECT title FROM songs;

### Selecting newer songs or songs deemed 'epic' ###

SELECT title FROM songs
   WHERE mood = 'epic'
   OR released > 1990;

### Selecting songs released after 1900 that are deemed 'epic' and less than 4 minutes long ###

SELECT title FROM songs
   WHERE mood = 'epic'
   AND released > 1990
   AND duration < 240
