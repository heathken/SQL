--- In this SQL, I'm querying a sales and customer info database to uncover sales insights ---



--- 1. How many orders were placed in January? ---
SELECT SUM(Quantity) FROM JanSales



--- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? ---
SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'



--- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. ---
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM customers

LEFT JOIN FebSales
ON customers.acctnum = FebSales.orderID;
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


--- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? ---
SELECT Product, price 
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1



--- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products)---
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product



--- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?---
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), price, SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue 
FROM FebSales

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product



--- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? ---

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(FebSales.Quantity * FebSales.price) AS average_spent
FROM FebSales

LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id 
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'



--- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. ---

SELECT FebSales.Product, SUM(Quantity)
