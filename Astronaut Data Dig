#### This project evaluated Astronaut data to gain further understanding/insights ####


### First I took a look at a sample of the data to see what properties each row had ###

SELECT * FROM astronauts LIMIT 20;

### This query determines how many of the 357 astronauts were male and female, returning 307 male and 50 female ###

SELECT Gender, COUNT (*)
FROM astronauts 
GROUP BY Gender; 

### This query determines all of the different Undergraduate Majors ###

SELECT Undergraduate_Major,
COUNT(*) FROM astronauts
GROUP BY Undergraduate_Major;

### This query determines how many astronauts completed more than 5 space missions ###

SELECT name FROM astronauts
WHERE Space_Flights >= 5

### This query creates a new column determining the average amount of time spent in space for each mission, sorting each astronaut from greatest to least ###

SELECT Name, Space_Flights, 
AVG(Space_Flight_hr/Space_Flights)
AS "Avg_Space_Flight_hr_per_mission"
FROM astronauts
GROUP BY Name
ORDER BY Avg_Space_Flight_hr_per_mission DESC;

### This query is similar to the above, while also filtering to only pull active female astronauts ###

SELECT Name, Gender, Space_Flights, 
AVG(Space_Flight_hr/Space_Flights)
AS "Avg_Space_Flight_hr_per_mission"
FROM astronauts
WHERE Gender = "Female"
AND Status = "Active"
GROUP BY Name
ORDER BY Avg_Space_Flight_hr_per_mission DESC;
